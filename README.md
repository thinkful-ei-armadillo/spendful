## Summary

Reach your financial goals by tracking every dollar you spend and earn.  This app allows you to 
add all of your incomes and expenses and visualize them through convenient charts and graphs.  The
front-end utilizes React to create a responsive design.  The back-end leverages the RRule library to allow
for recurring expenses.
